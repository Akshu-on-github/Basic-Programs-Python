## :exclamation: Notice

**This repo is now read-only.**

This repo has come a long way. It has helped
- Engage with workshop participants and new contributors
- Explain Issues, PRs, Discussions, and other GitHub features
- Experiment with the ins and outs of Git and Repo management

However - as all good things, this too must come to an end. I won't be able maintain this repo further, but to preserve a record of the journey of its contributors, I'll set this to public archive. Thanks for sticking with this project thus far!
