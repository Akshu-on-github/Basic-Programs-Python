## Naming Convention
### For Program Files
- Use the `.py` extension
- Use lowercase
- Use hyphens to separate words
- Example:
  ```md
  name-of-code-sample.py
  ```

### For commits
- Same as above
- Use the Issue prefix for the first commit. For example:
  ```md
  [CODE] Add name-of-code-sample.py
  ```
- For other changes, use an imperative that describes the commit. For example:
  ```md
  Add comments for clarity
  ```

### For Pull Requests
- Use the Issue prefix, similar to the first commit's message. For example:
  ```md
  [CODE] Add name-of-code-sample.py
  ```
